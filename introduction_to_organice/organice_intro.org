** Why would you care?

   - I'm a tooling nut
   - I even got the job interview as a lecturer by accident, because I
     gave a talk on GTD 9 years ago
   - Over the last 15 years, I went over a great many tools
   - Since 6 years, most of my work, reading and communications happen
     within Emacs
   - *Org mode* is my daily driver *for everything* from
     - Project Management
     - Time Tracking
     - Quotes
     - Bookkeeping and Controlling
     - Presentations
   - Hence, I'm happily committed to Org Mode \(^_^)/

* What is organice?
** If Org mode is so great, why a new tool?
*** Two pragmatic reasons

    1. It's not really convenient to have a laptop/PC handy all the time.
    2. Not everyone is an Emacs user.

    Are you a fan of Org mode? If so, you probably want to have access to your Org files at any time - even when away from your computer. Or maybe you want to collaborate with other people who are not Emacs users themselves.

** Description

   organice is an implementation of [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] without the dependency of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]. It is built for mobile and desktop browsers and syncs with Dropbox, Google Drive and WebDAV.

** What does it look like?

    \center\includegraphics[height=0.9\textheight]{images/screenshot--overview.png}
** Development

   - The project is free and open source software, of course

   - It has an AGPL-3.0 license, a public code of conduct and contributing guidelines

   - You can find the source code here: [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice][https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice]]

   - organice is built using the popular front-end frameworks React and
     Redux

     - Enabling a wide range of contributors

* Demo

** Demo

   - Optimized for mobile and desktop use
   - [[https://organice.200ok.ch][https://organice.200ok.ch]]
   - No back-end
     - No storage of data on our servers
     - We also don't use analytics

*** Inception!

   - Let's check some Org mode features in organice!

** Actions                                                         :noexport:
*** Todos [1/4] [25%]
    This header has a few TODO items as subheaders.
**** TODO Learn how to use TODOs in organice
     To advance the todo state of a header, swipe right on it until the background turns green.

     Try advancing the todo state of this header a few times!
***** There's also a setting once you're signed in to enable tapping on the TODO label itself to advance the todo state. Its off by default because I thought the behavior would be confusing unless explained, but I recommend turning it on!
**** DONE Check out organice
**** START Investigate custom TODO states
     organice also supports [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Workflow-states.html#Workflow-states][custom todo states]] (if declared at the top of the file). Swipe right on this header a few times.

     Note that when the cycle restarts, it defaults to the first set of todo states. Manually edit the header to get back to a different todo state cycle (more on editing headers below!)
*** Editing headers
    When you select a header the "header action drawer" appears. The first two buttons in this drawer edit the header and description respectively. Try editing this header.
*** Tags
    The next button in the header action drawer will bring up the tag editor.

    This editor lets you add, modify, and reorder tags, as well as giving you easy access to all tags in the file.

    Try it out on these headers:
**** Dogs:
***** Eloise                                           :cute:middleaged:tiny:
***** Clooney                                               :cute:young:tiny:
***** Murphy                                               :cute:young:small:
***** Starla                                                :cute:old:medium:
***** Rex                                                   :cute:old:medium:
***** Maz                                             :cute:middleaged:large:
*** Focusing
    The next button in the header action drawer "focuses" on a header, hiding all others and promoting it to the top level. Press the button again to "unfocus".

    This is purely visual - your org file isn't affected under the hood.

    I find this useful for focusing on my "Groceries" list when I go to the grocery store. Give it a shot on this grocery list:
**** Groceries
     - [ ] Mangoes
     - [ ] Dark chocolate
     - [ ] Carrots
*** Adding and removing headers
    To add a new header, press the + button in the header action drawer

    To remove a header, swipe left on the header until the background turns red.
*** Moving headers
    To move a header, click on the four-way arrows button at the bottom of the screen with a header selected. 6 buttons will appear for moving headers.

    The center 4 move the header up, down, left, and right. The 2 outermost buttons move the header and its entire nested subtree.

    Give them a try on these nested headers to get a feel for how they operate:
**** A few of my favorite things:
***** Food
****** Chocolate
******* Dark chocolate
******* Milk chocolate
******* Crispy chocolate
****** Mangoes
***** Text editors
****** Emacs
***** Mountain bikes
****** Santa Cruz
****** Trek
****** Giant
****** Specialized
***** Dogs
****** Eloise
****** Maz
****** Starla
****** Rex
****** Clooney
*** Syncing
    The "cloud" button in the lower left hand corner syncs changes to your chosen sync service (Dropbox or Google Drive).

    If there's a newer version on the server and no local changes, it'll pull.

    If there's no newer version on the server and there are local changes, it'll push.

    Otherwise, it'll ask what you want to do.

    This button isn't enabled in this demo :)

    If you'd like to automatically push changes as you make them, you can enable "Live sync" in settings.
*** Undo / Redo
    When you're signed in, you'll have =undo= and =redo= buttons in the
    headerbar.
** Tables                                                          :noexport:
   organice has native support for viewing and editing tables.

   Try playing around with this one by first clicking on a cell:

   | Dog name | Age | Weight (in lbs) | Parent   | Score (1-10) |
   |----------+-----+-----------------+----------+--------------|
   | Eloise   |   3 |             5.1 | Erin     |           15 |
   |----------+-----+-----------------+----------+--------------|
   | Starla   |  15 |              40 | Sarah S  |           15 |
   |----------+-----+-----------------+----------+--------------|
   | Rex      |  15 |              45 | Sarah S  |           15 |
   |----------+-----+-----------------+----------+--------------|
   | Maz      |   1 |              55 | Brittany |           15 |
   |----------+-----+-----------------+----------+--------------|
   | Clooney  | 0.1 |             4.8 | Sarah R  |           15 |
   |----------+-----+-----------------+----------+--------------|
   | Murphy   | 0.5 |              25 | Jordan   |           15 |

*** New action drawer items
    When a table cell is selected, a table-specific action drawer appears.

    The leftmost icon allows you to edit a cell.

    On the right side, the top two icons let you add and remove rows. The bottom two icons let you add and remove columns.

*** Moving rows and columns
    When a table cell is selected, the four-way arrow button at the bottom of the screen changes to manipulate tables.

    Press up and down to move rows, and left and right to move columns.
*** Format specifiers (like <r> and <10>) aren't yet supported, but they're on my list!
    If this is an important feature to you, please let me know by upvoting [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/25][the issue]] on GitHub
** Lists and checkboxes                                            :noexport:
   organice has native support for displaying plain lists and checkboxes

   Plain:

   - plain list item 1
   - plain list item 2
     - sub item 1
   - plain list item 3

   Ordered:

   1. Item 1
   2. Item 2
   20. [@20] Item 20
   21. Item 21

   Checkboxes:

   - [-] 1 [1/2]
     - [ ] 1.1 [0%]
       - [ ] 1.1.1
     - [X] 1. 2
   - [X] 2

   Currently, plain lists are mostly display only (except that you can
   check/uncheck checkboxes). If native support for manipulating plain
   lists is important to you, please let me know by upvoting
   [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/issues/26][the issue]] on
   Github
** Timestamps                                                      :noexport:
   organice has native support for displaying and editing timestamps.

   Try tapping on the timestamps below to get a feel for the editor:

   <2018-09-17 Sun>

   [2018-09-17 Sun]

   [2018-09-17 Sun +1d]

   [2018-09-17 Sun 10:00-11:30]

   <2018-09-17 Sun>--<2018-09-25 Tue>
** Property lists                                                  :noexport:
   organice has native support for viewing and editing property lists. To bring up an editor, expand the ~PROPERTIES~ drawer below and tap on any of the properties.
*** Example
    :PROPERTIES:
    :callsign: Maverick
    :eyewear:  Aviators
    :launch-date: [1986-05-16 Fri]
    :END:

** Planning                                                        :noexport:
   organice has native support for adding and editing DEADLINE and SCHEDULED items. It also supports [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html][repeaters]] and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Deadlines-and-scheduling.html#Deadlines-and-scheduling][delays]]. Check out these examples:
*** An item with a deadline
    DEADLINE: <2018-10-03 Wed>
*** An item that is scheduled
    SCHEDULED: <2018-10-18 Thu>
*** An item with both
    DEADLINE: <2018-10-02 Tue> SCHEDULED: <2018-10-02 Tue>
    DEADLINE: <2018-10-02 Tue>
    SCHEDULED: <2018-10-02 Tue>
*** TODO An item with a repeater - try swiping right to advance to the DONE state
    DEADLINE: <2018-11-01 Thu ++1w>
** Capture                                                         :noexport:
   organice supports something like org-capture in the form of customizable, quickly accessible buttons for creating new headers.

   Click the button in the bottom right corner of the screen to see some examples. The first button, the lemon, will create a new entry in the "Groceries" list below this. The second button adds an entry to a more deeply nested header.

   Once signed in, you can set up capture templates that specify header paths (and various other configurations). These capture templates can also sync between your devices (if you enable settings sync).
*** Inbox
** Agenda                                                          :noexport:
   organice has a basic agenda view that you can access by tapping the calendar button at the bottom of the page.

   Tap a header in this view to jump to it, and tap on the date to switch to a more readable relative date format.

   These overdue items with deadlines should show up on today's entry:
*** TODO check out the organice agenda view
    DEADLINE: <2018-09-10 Mon>
*** TODO install organice to your phones homescreen
    SCHEDULED: <2018-09-17 Mon>
* Closing words

** Related work

   - organice has custom parser code for Org files

   - It works quite fine and has unit tests to prove it

   - However, writing a parser for a complex syntax like Org mode in custom code is hard

   - We are also in the in the process of implementing a proper BNF based
     parser and a set of tests behind that written in Clojure / ClojureScript

   - If you're interested, please check it out:
