* Play Emacs like an instrument
  
** Rationale

This is a talk I gave at the [[https://www.meetup.com/zh-clj-Zurich-Clojure-User-Group/events/249150421/][Clojure Meetup in Zurich, Switzerland]].

** Abstract

Lean back and relax while enjoying a deep dive into the wonderful
world of the Emacs editor. Emacs renaissance came with the advent of
Clojure and undoubtedly is the most popular editor among Clojurians
today. Of course there is a lot more you can do with Emacs, but much
like playing an instrument, great skill only comes with practice.

You neither need to be an Emacs user nor a Clojure Programmer and
neither do you need to contemplate about becoming one either to enjoy
this talk. Much like you don't become a professional musician by
attending a concert, but it might very well be inspiring.
