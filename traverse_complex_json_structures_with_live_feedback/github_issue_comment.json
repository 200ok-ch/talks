    "body": "Thanks for the PR, fixing typos certainly helps the codebase to become more readable. I apologize for putting it in there in the first place!\r\n\r\nIf possible, I'd like to not make breaking changes for existing users. I added this feature in the first place so that people don't lose work or data. Without this, it's very easy for people to get into a conflict state. Having build some products, my experience is not that people will silently go to the settings and re-enable something that they previously enabled and be fine with it - they will rightfully be very unhappy and might even opt to not use organice, again, because it broke their workflow. Reducing churn is a great way to increase the user and contributor base.\r\n\r\norganice actually does have migrations for making changes like this one! And if written in an idempotent manner, there's no need to remove them (similarly to DB migrations in back-end frameworks). I've added such a migration to the PR: https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/pull/319/commits/3776af07a55d769b069e45ec811480b99bc3eba9\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, introducing this has the same issue as #320. After running the code, the setting is gone:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocalStorage.getItem(\"shouldSyncOnBecomingVisible\")\r\n\"undefined\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe settings implementation currently is not very solid (based on the two problems in two PRs). Since we're about to potentially break two existing settings, now is the best time to clean that up. I'm very happy to help and already invested quite some time on #320 and will continue to do so when I can!"
